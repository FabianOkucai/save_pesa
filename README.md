# save_pesa

Minimal Flutter project scaffold created in-place.

Next steps to finish setup (requires Flutter SDK):

PowerShell
```
cd "c:\Users\STUDENT\Desktop\fabian\save_pesa"
flutter create .
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you only want to run on a specific platform, use `-d windows` / `-d chrome` / `-d <device id>`.
